## Problem Statement

Many people die due to the unavailability of medical information  during emergency cases and due to the delay of the ambulance. In the recent pandemic the lack of information about the bed, oxygen, and blood availability caused various deaths. To solve this issue we will be creating a website which will help in improving the health care system and reduce the loss of lives in our country.
