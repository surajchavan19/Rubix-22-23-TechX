## Problem Statement

Many people die due to the unavailability of medical information  during emergency cases and due to the delay of the ambulance. In the recent pandemic the lack of information about the bed, oxygen, and blood availability caused various deaths. To solve this issue we will be creating a website which will help in improving the health care system and reduce the loss of lives in our country.

Features build till now
1) A QR code card that will contain the medical information of the patient.
2) Ambulance service which will help the ambulance arrive as soon as possible. 
3) Centralized platform containing the information regarding the availability of blood bags, oxygen cylinders, and beds.
4) Helping users book appointments with doctors and storing the prescription given by the doctor on our website.
